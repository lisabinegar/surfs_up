# Climate Analysis on Oahu: An analysis

## Overview of climate analysis

Our client, W. Avy, was interested in learning about temperature trends year-round before fully investing and committing to a surf shop in Oahu. The major question is whether an ice cream shop business will be profitable and sustainable all year. The assumption is that consistently warmer temperatures will drive customers to the surf shop, as would be expected in the summer months. Will it be warm enough in December for customers to continue to surf and frequent the surf shop? Our analysis focused on temperature data, comparing the months of December and June.

## Results 

### Key Difference One: 
- One key difference in weather on the island of Oahu between December and June are the slightly cooler temperatures in December as compared to June. This is not wholly unexpected as we are contrasting summer and winter months, though the mean temperature difference is merely 4 degrees – a mean of 71 degrees in December as compared to 75 degrees in June.  

### Key Difference Two: 
- A second key difference when comparing December and June climates are the percentiles in temperatures. The lower 25% percent of temperatures range is 69 degrees in December, as compared to 73 degrees in June; the 75% percentile temperature in December is 74 degrees, and up to 85 degrees in June. This emphasizes a slightly broader range of temperatures than the mean alone would reveal. 

### Key Difference Three: 
- A third key difference in climates on the island of Oahu, or perhaps in the data available, are the number of temperatures that were counted for each set of temperatures. A total count of 1517 measurements were taken in December, and a total of 1700 temperatures were counted in June. These temperatures were tracked across of a span of approximately seven years, from 2010 to 2017. As there are fewer data points in December as compared to June, it is hard to know if we are lacking data from December that paint a more or less comparable picture when compared to June temperatures. Is it even cooler in December than this data set indicates, or are temperatures fairly consistent when compared to June? 

## Summary

As the discussion above would indicate, though December is slightly cooler on average when compared to June, there does not appear to be a significant difference in temperature data obtained. One additional query worth analyzing within climate data could include the dew point, or humidity, which is a measurement that contributes to the “feels like” temperature. Querying these two factors would provide additional context and a human response to the average temperatures. Though it may be slightly cooler in December, what does it “feel like”? Is this comparable to June, or is there a minimal difference? Querying these two data points would certainly provide a greater year-round context for W. Avy as he embarks on an ambitious surf shop enterprise in Oahu.
